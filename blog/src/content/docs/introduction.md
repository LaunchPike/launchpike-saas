# Start here: Your MVP launch, guided

Welcome! You're about to stand up a production-ready SaaS base using this **free, open-source** template.

_The rest of this guide is a **runbook** — short steps, copy-paste blocks, quick checks._

## What you'll do next (at a glance)

1. Boot the app locally
2. Turn on authentication (email + optional social)
3. Wire email sending (dev → prod)
4. Pick and connect payments (Stripe / Lemon Squeezy / Unibee)
5. Add analytics (Plausible or Google Analytics + consent, if needed)
6. Optional: enable file uploads (AWS S3)
7. Set basic SEO + ship

## What's inside (the stack)

- **Wasp** — full-stack framework (React, Node.js, Prisma)
- **Astro (Starlight)** — docs & blog
- **Payments — Stripe or Lemon Squeezy**
- **Analytics — Plausible or Google Analytics**
- **AI — OpenAI API** integrated (Replicate coming soon)
- **File uploads — AWS S3**
- **Email — SendGrid, Mailgun, or SMTP**
- **Styling — Tailwind CSS**
- **Admin UI — TailAdmin** components for Tailwind

Because Wasp is the full-stack backbone, you get:

- **Authentication** — email verification + social auth with minimal code  
- **End-to-end type safety** — backend functions typed, inferred on the client (type-safe Links, too)  
- **Jobs** — define background/cron work in config  
- **One-command deploy** — via CLI to Fly.io (also works with Railway, Netlify, etc.)

## Free & Open-Source
