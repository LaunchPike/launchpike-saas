    question: "Why is this free?",
    answer: `Because our biggest goal right now is adoption. LaunchPike is open-source - we want as many founders and builders as possible to ship faster, give us feedback, and grow the ecosystem. The more people who launch with it, the better it becomes.

What’s in it for us? Community traction, credibility, and long-term sustainability. As we grow, we’ll introduce optional paid services (like one-click deployment, hosting, premium integrations, and support). But the core framework, the part that saves you from wasting a week on boilerplate - will always stay free.`,

    question: "Deployment looks too complex :(",

      "We provide step-by-step guides, ready to run CLI scripts, and working demo apps.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can’t I just vibe-code my MVP?",
    answer:
      "Vibe-coded MVPs miss critical infra like auth, payments, and email. They waste time and are harder to extend or maintain.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my stack’s different, can I still use this?",
    answer: `Yes, as long as you’re comfortable with React and basic Node.js conventions.

Libraries are independent. Use UniBee or Stripe or Lemon Squeezy for payments, SendGrid or Mailgun for email, Postgres out of the box, and any SQL that Prisma supports if you prefer.

The runbook and patterns are framework agnostic, so you can lift the workflow and swap adapters to fit your setup.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Does LaunchPike support AI - Copilot, Cursor, etc?",
    answer: `Short answer yes. LaunchPike is AI-ready and AI accelerated.

Why AI editors love LaunchPike:

- Complete codebase with clear patterns.   Your AI editor gets real project context instead of a blank file.

- Consistent naming and file structure  Predictable folders and conventions help Cursor or Copilot generate code that fits your app on the first try.

- Built in building blocks  - AI can wire new features into these primitives fast.`,

LaunchPike hit different. The setup felt like someone had already done the boring parts for me, auth, payments, emails and left me with just the fun bit: building my idea. The docs actually read like instructions you’d give a friend, not a reference manual, and the whole flow just made sense. Honestly, it’s the first time I’ve felt like ‘oh wow, I can actually get something real in front of users without burning a week’`,
